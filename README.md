# Assets for BUSMALL Lab

Bus Mall is an app that present 3 pictures to the user. The user will click on one image and then be presented with 3 new random images. This will occur 25 times. Every click will be recorded and stored, every view will be recorded and stored. After the 25 selections have been completed the user will be presented with a graph that shows the most popular selections.

8-22: created the framework for the HTML and CSS files, brought over the images from lab11 assets.
Collaborated with Karlo and Sam for this one.

8-26: Added the Chart.js to HTML and js.app. Made the values previously stored for clicked, viewed and alt in the constructor work with the chart.js with a for loop. Made some CSS changes. Will spend more time tomorrow styling CSS.

8-27: Added the rest of the CSS styles. Tried to make everything look nice. Added a hover feature to the chart as well. Collaborated with Karlo and Brandon during this assignment.
