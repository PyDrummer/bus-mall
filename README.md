# Assets for BUSMALL Lab

Bus Mall is an app that present 3 pictures to the user. The user will click on one image and then be presented with 3 new random images. This will occur 25 times. Every click will be recorded and stored, every view will be recorded and stored. After the 25 selections have been completed the user will be presented with a graph that shows the most popular selections.
